# Terraform-Beginner
**Introduction of Terraform**

Terraform is an open-source tool that allows you to define and manage infrastructure as code. It automates the creation, updating, and management of resources (e.g., virtual machines, networks, and databases) across various cloud providers (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). You define the desired state of your infrastructure in configuration files, and Terraform handles provisioning and management.

**Why Use Terraform?**


**Easy Setup:** Write a list of what you need, and Terraform takes care of creating it.

**Automation:** Terraform can make changes, remove old resources, or update things automatically.

**Consistency:** Ensures all environments (like testing, staging, and production) are set up the same way.

**Works with Everything:** Supports most cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) and many other tools.

**Team Collaboration:** Multiple people can work on the same setup without conflicts.
